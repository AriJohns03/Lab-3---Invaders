# Invaders
## Arcade game remake in CSharp

Invaders is the final project of Stellman & Greene's [*Head First C#*](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfcsharp/).

The book gives some guidance in the form of program architecture and class diagrams, 
the rest is left up to the reader to implement.

The game still needs some tweaking to get the difficulty right and
perhaps a rewrite of the invaders' returnFire() method.
